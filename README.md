# Credit-Risk-Analyzer
Spotle Capstone Project

Credit risk analyzer? What is credit risk? An obvious question that came in our minds immediately. Well, in your life you must have given your books to your friends to read; may be story books or study materials etc. Few of them have returned the books and unfortunately few haven’t. This happened with almost all of us. Now when a person falls in a pattern of not returning what he or she has borrowed earlier, you are cautious about them when they ask for another book.  



Now there may be many reasons why they did not return. It may be that you forgot, you gave them books; and they also forgot; nothing is intentional. It may be that they have lost the book accidentally. It may be that they were ignorant and did not keep the book safely. It may also be that they did not return the books after many follow ups.



In the first case you wouldn’t like to make your friend responsible, as both of you forgot about the book for whatever reasons. In the second case, you may say, your friend could have been little cautious, though it is accidental. So he or she gets a benefit of doubt. In the third case surely your friend did not take care of the book and you may not like to give him or her another book to borrow from you. In the fourth case your friend did not return the book after many follow ups. He or she is clearly a defaulter. You wouldn’t give him or her another book to borrow from you.



In the whole episode what did you do? You have done many things without even understanding you followed them to come to a decision.



First, you gave your books to your friends based on familiarity and trust.

Second, you collected data about them in terms of who returned and who did not.

Third, you analyzed the data to understand why they did not return.

Fourth, based on your understanding you took decision about who you would give another book to borrow who you wouldn’t.



Ok, we have now understood how we may take decisions about giving things to someone. Let’s take a look at a much wider aspect. All of us know what a credit card is. A credit card is a cashless transaction system that is linked with an account in a bank that issued the credit card. This account is called credit card account. In its physical form it is a plastic card that we need to swipe at merchant PoS machine to complete a transaction. We can also use the credit card details online to purchase things online. But how does this happen? The account linked with the credit card, has a given credit limit. When we purchase something using the credit card the money gets deducted form the credit limit and paid to the merchant. We have to return the money to the account as per the billing cycle. Now, this credit limit is not the amount that we have paid in advance to the bank and kept for future usages through the credit card. This is essentially an amount that the bank has assigned to us, in our credit card account, as a some sort of approved loan amount. From where we can borrow money through the credit card at the merchant PoS machine or online, and return the money as per our approved repayment plan. This credit limit is a risk that bank is taking on you. Why? Because, if you use the money and do not return that to the bank, the bank loses the entire amount. This is a credit risk. 



Banks need to protect their interest before it can take risk on you and issue credit card to you. Banks use their previous credit card holders records for understanding the patterns of the card holders. It is a lot more complex process to predict whether a person who they do not know at personal level, will be a defaulter or not. Banks, along with the data from their own records, also use CIBIL data. CIBIL plays an important role here as it collects data from all your loan types, across financial institutes, over a period of time. As it is defined, “CIBIL Score is a three-digit numeric summary of your credit history. The score is derived using the credit history found in the CIBIL Report (also known as CIR i.e Credit Information Report). A CIR is an individual’s credit payment history across loan types and credit institutions over a period of time. A CIR does not contain details of your savings, investments or fixed deposits.” Higher the score better it is. The banks also consider market conditions, their current risk appetite etc before they issue a credit card to you. 



Based on all this data, banks want to develop a pattern that will tell them who are likely to be a defaulter and who are not. As an example, in its simplest form just for our understanding, let’s say, people who are salaried and own a house have lower number of default cases as compared to self employed people who are on rent. Or let’s say people at the higher income group have lesser cases of defaulting as compared to people belonging to the lower income group. If that are what the banks identify as patterns of defaulting they would like to test their formula with some data first. If the data support their formula, the banks would use this formula as an identifier of suspected defaulter, and issue credit cards based on that. This formula or rule or technique is credit risk analyzer. Banks collect applicants data from their credit card application forms. They also access the applicant’s CIBIL score. They use all the relevant information they need in their credit risk analyzer. All data are fed into the analyzer and based on the rules set in the analyzer an applicant’s application is accepted or rejected.

The data contains exhaustive information about card holders. Patterns based on these variables will indicate the likelihood of a new applicant to be a defaulter.



First, we will build a decision tree credit risk analyzer, based on a portion of the data. Second, we will test the credit risk analyzer based on the remaining data. If we have found an analyzer that is tested ok, we will use the analyzer to classify new applicants as per their likelihood of being a defaulter.
